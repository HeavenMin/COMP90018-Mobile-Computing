### Assignment2 (App Prototype) TODO
### Requirements
#### Application
  * It must address a problem that fits the __design brief__
  * It must fulfil a need, address a problem, or explore an opportunity that benefits a specific user group other than __students__
  * It must make use of __sensors__ in the device
  * It must make use of the __Azure cloud__ infrastructure
  * Need to document the source code appropriately.

#### Video
  * __explanation of the problem__ the app aims to solve
  * __a justification of how it addresses the design breif__
  * description of the applicaiton __design process__
    * __videos or pictures__ of brainstorming sessions and participant interviews
    * __consent forms__
  * __live demonstration__

#### Criteria
  * Fit to the brief

    * fulfil a __real need__
    * solve a __real problem__, explore a real opportunity
    * supporting __active decision-making__
    * likely to lead to a safer future
  * User Research

   * go out and __interview__ users other than students
  * User experience
    * the __usability__ of the application
    * make good use of __aesthetic design__ principles

### Assignments1 TODO
1. Choose the research topic
2. Find recent work on the topic
3. Imagine an Application, create __diagrams__, __mockups__, __scenarios__, does not have to be a mobile phone application
4. imagine the research process to design and evaluate the Application
5. write report using _ACM Extended Abstracts format_ in [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/597a6e27ca5686f65d5a37f1). See tamplate: [Template](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/other/chi-extended-abstracts-latex-template)
>  Written as if the work has been already done. Use the past tense and the first person.Write in active voice .

6. Record the presentation video. Contain
  * short overview of the related work
  * how the proposed prototype is different to or builds upon these past works
  * a visual presentation
  * an example of a usage scenario
  * how the application addresses the brief

### The paper evaluation criteria
  * Does it address the brief?
  * Quality of the paper formatting: does the paper follow the format? Are the references in the right format? Is the research appropriately illustrated?
  * Quality of the writing: is the paper well-structured and organised? Is it written clearly? Is it engaging? Are there grammar or spelling mistakes?
  * Coverage of related work: is the related work appropriately covered? Are there important works missing? Are the works appropriately referenced? Are the works discussed relevant to the proposed research plan?
  * Quality of the fictional prototype: is the imagined prototype novel? Does it build upon previous work?
  * Quality of the research plan: are the design methods appropriate for eliciting requirements from the chosen user group? Are the evaluation methods appropriate for assessing the prototype? Are the methods described in detail?

### The video scored criteria
  * Quality of the visuals
  * Quality of the delivery
  * Quality of the discussion
